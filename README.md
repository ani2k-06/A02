Part 1: Directions on Using WebStorm

Step 1: Install WebStorm
Download WebStorm from the official JetBrains website: https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download/
Follow the installation instructions for your OS (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

Step 2: Create a New Project
Open WebStorm.
Click on New Project.
Select a template (like HTML or Node.js) or an empty project.

Step 3: Set Up Git Integration in WebStorm
Go to File > Settings (or Preferences on macOS).
Navigate to Version Control > Git and make sure the Git path is configured.
If Git is not installed, download it from: https://git-scm.com/ and install it.

Step 4: Initialize a Git Repository
Right-click the project folder in WebStorm.
Select Git > Initialize Repository.
This will initialize a local Git repository in your project.

Step 5: Create a New Repository on GitHub
Go to https://github.com/ and log into your account.
Click on New Repository.
Name your repository A02 and ensure itâ€™s public.
Check Add a README file and click Create Repository.

Step 6: Connect WebStorm Project to GitHub
In WebStorm, go to VCS > Git > Push to connect your local repository to your GitHub repository.
Click Define Remote and add the URL for your repository: https://github.com/#enteryourusername/A02.

Step 7: Pushing Code to GitHub
Make changes to your project (e.g., edit the README.md).
Go to VCS > Git > Commit to stage your changes.
Write a clear commit message like Task: Create Repository.
Click Commit and then go to Push to push the changes to GitHub.

Step 8: Fetch and Pull Changes from GitHub
If you want to fetch updates from GitHub, go to VCS > Git > Fetch.
To pull new changes, go to VCS > Git > Pull.

Step 9: Branching and Merging
To create a new branch, go to VCS > Git > Branches > New Branch.
To merge branches, go to VCS > Git > Merge and select the branch you want to merge.
